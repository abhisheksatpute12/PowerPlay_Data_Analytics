 SQL Data Analytics Project  To Analyze  Movie Performances
 * In this project I have examined the Movie dataset with SQL and helped them to understand its business growth.
## Features:
1. Which is the movie(s) with the smallest runtime? Which is the movie(s) with the highest runtime?
2. List the top 5 production houses (by budget), their top 5 most popular movies, their revenue, and their vote average.
3. List the production house for every year from 2000-2016 which has released the most number of movies in that year.
4. You will invest  your savings in a production company. You have two choices: "Marvel Studios" and "DC Comics". Which company would you bet on? This is an open-ended question. Define your own metrics to measure which one is a better investment opportunity and defend your analysis.
